This is a prototype written for Wellframe for a Spam Filtering API.  The
algorithm is based on Naive Bayes Spam Filtering technique.  The
implementation is for illustration purpose only.

Prerequisites:
  JDK 1.6
  Maven 3.2.5
  Tomcat 7

Set up:

  Please run setup.sh to install Boilerpipe library to Maven as the public
  repo is currently missing this library.


To warm up this app, use the CommandLineTool to submit directories of spam
and ham messages.

The API is available on a web deployment with two interfaces:

  Check message:

    /check-message?message=<message>

    This is to check if a message is spam.  The return value is either
    SPAM or HAM, both with a percentage of confidence in parenthesis.  For
    example: "SPAM (55%)"

  Mark message:

    /mark-message?message=<message>&isSpam=<y|n>

    Mark if a message is spam or ham.
