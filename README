This is a prototype written for Wellframe for a Spam Filtering API.  The
algorithm is based on Naive Bayes Spam Filtering technique.  The
implementation is for illustration purpose only.

Prerequisites:
  JDK 1.6
  Maven 3.2.5
  Tomcat 7

Set up:

  Please run setup.sh to install Boilerpipe library to Maven as the public
  repo is currently missing this library.

  Run following to compile and generate a WAR file for web deployment.
  
    mvn install
  
To warm up this app, use the CommandLineTool to submit directories of spam
and ham messages.

  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.edng.wellframe.spamfilter.tool.CommandLineTool \
    -Dexec.args="<directory> <y|n>"

The API is available on a web deployment with two interfaces:

  Check message:

    /check-message?message=<message>

    This is to check if a message is spam.  The return value is either
    SPAM or HAM, both with a percentage of confidence in parenthesis.  For
    example: "SPAM (55%)"

  Mark message:

    /mark-message?message=<message>&isSpam=<y|n>

    Mark if a message is spam or ham.
